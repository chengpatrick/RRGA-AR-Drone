[Unity Controller for Tello](https://tellopilots.com/threads/unity-controller-for-tello-3d-tracking-tello-simulator-flight-stick-support.2288/) 

This project would not be possible without the hard work put into these two libraries.

[Krag's TelloLib library](https://tellopilots.com/threads/a-tello-library.266/) Exposes the lower level tello API in C#.

[TelloForUnity](https://github.com/comoc/TelloForUnity) Allows TelloLib to work properly in the Unity editor, including the video feed.
